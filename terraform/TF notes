Tf IAC tool. code process

first we need to add a provider.
next the login access to it.
next what all resources are allready there in cloud by using "data"
next what all resources need to be created by using " resource"

as we cant give all details in main.tf we use variable.tf or terraform.tfvars file these variable files should be created at the time of execution by the users so that main.tf can be re-used multiple times.

once the files are ready do the terraform init, plan, apply .
after doing apply and the execution is done we get some files in our pc "tfstate" this file is used to modify the resurce and even destroy, so this file is very important for us.

TF migrtion process.

first prepare config file by using example from  "work_git\terraform\S3_import\install-scripts_s3"

terraform plan -generate-config-out="install-scripts_s3.tf"

terraform import aws_s3_bucket.scripts_bucket install-scripts1

terraform plan //when run this command it should as "No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration."

then the migration is as expected

Module's

in TF one script where it can be re-used in simple ways is called as module. for that we need to convert 
code to vairable way.

so main config file will have noting to change and wont create any issue.

once config file is done we can call it from any config file with module, building block.

Ex: 
1. terraform/Ec2/main.tf        = whole script to create a Ec2
2. terraform/Ec2/some_type/     = this is without script where we use module building block

in 2. folder create a main.tf, variables.tf, terraform.tfvars file 

in main.tf file 
write as follows

//
module "Ec2" {
  source = "terraform/Ec2/"
}
// this will pull details from above folder to create EC2

update variables.tf, terraform.tfvars files according to ur need and run plan, apply. this will create the ec2.

if we need to pull module from Git repo use this way

module "Ec2" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/Praveengoud25/work_git.git//terraform/Ec2_module"
}

copy the repo url, after .git add // and add folder_path
 
------------

* tf -chdir 
this is used to open project folder from diffrent folder and run tf commands

terraform.exe -chdir=foldername cmd // this will run tf cmd on any folder from tf parent folder.
mostly this way is used
